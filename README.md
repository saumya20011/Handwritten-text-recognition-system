# Handwritten-text-recognition-system
This project seeks to classify an individual handwritten word so that handwritten text can be translated to a digital form. We have used two main approaches to accomplish this task: classifying words directly and character segmentation. For the former, we have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with various architectures to train a model that can accurately classify words then these segmented characters are passed to a CNN for classification, and then reconstruct each word according to the results of classification and segmentation.
